## General info
This project aims at forecasting powerplant energy constrains, i.e. minimum energy and maximum power / energy based on historical data using machine learning techniques.

This is a multivariate regression problem whith a timeseries dimension whose predictions must respect a number of constrains, which makes it unusual and challenging.
	
## Technologies
Project is implemented in Jupyter notebooks using Python. Mains libraries are Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, Matplotlib, LIME.
